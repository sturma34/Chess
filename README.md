# Chess
Simply compile and run ChessPlayer.java to play.

To move, type the starting square of the piece you want to move and the square you are moving it to in the command line (ex: "A2 A3"). The board flips around after each turn for easy usage by two players. Then, just keep playing until someone forces a checkmate!
